============================
Shell script common template
============================

-----------
Description
-----------
Millions of developers write shell scripts to solve various types of tasks. I use shell scripts to simplify deployment, life-cycle management, installation or simply as a glue language.
The problem is nobody actually cares about shell scripts style and quality. To overcome that issue I decided to create a simple (and hopefully useful) shell script template.

Features
--------
- command-line arguments handling
- synchronization
- some basic help

Disclaimer
----------
This is **beta** code.  It is probably okay for production environments, but may not work exactly as expected. Refunds will not be given.
